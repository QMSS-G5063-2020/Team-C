Story of Migrants

(https://qmss-g5063-2020.github.io/Team-C/Richa/project.html)


Get to know more about migration. We wanted to research about countries which have heavy per capita migration. 

This search led us to Venezuela, South Sudan and Syria.

We have developed visualizations that will help you understand the challenging circumstances in these countries, narratives around them and also future projections.
