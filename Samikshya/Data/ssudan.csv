peace   coming   started with humanitarian issues because they are related   the suffering   the citizens     want a peace that the citizens the displaced and the refugees can feel     manage

Government covers other issues   addition   the delivery   humanitarian assistance These include a cessation   hostilities and formation   committees   monitor implementation Humanitarian assistance flow   from inside and outside Sudan from organisations inside and outside the country     June the Nuba Mountains Liberation Council decided   appoint Abdel Aziz alHilu   SPLMN leader and remove Agar and secretarygeneral Yasir Arman   decided   ban the men from entering the liberated areas   the southern Blue Nile and South Kordofan The ban was justified   the grounds that Agar and Arman refuse   include selfdetermination rights   the negotiations with the government even though     what the Nuba Mountains want This sparked violent clashes   which dozens were killed because   ethnic mobilisation Since that time the SPLMN split into movements   exerted enormous efforts for a long time   avoid this before the split and when   started Agar   this connection   offered six initiatives   prevent the split   addition   the initiatives proposed   South Sudan s President Salva Kiir Mayardit who mediated three meetings with alHilu   addition   the initiatives made   friendly heads   state But all failed and   were unable   agree   a least common denominator Brother Abdel Aziz   intransigent   his position which   not acceptable     because   believe the demands     insisting upon cannot   accomplished   reached Agar points out   this connection that the separation   South Sudan from Sudan did not solve the problem but   the contrary worsened     the separation did not solve the problems   South Sudan but made them more intractable how then can   consider selfdetermination   a mechanism for a solution?
2,asks AlHilu   demanding selfdetermination for the Blue Nile and South Kordofan through a referendum   independence and the establishment   a secular state But Agar says   believe that granting selfdetermination   the areas   the pattern   the South Sudan experiment would   futile and would prolong the war instead   bringing peace closer There are objective reasons for this belief including the fact that there     geographical contiguity between the areas and because there are Arab tribes there unlike the situation   South Sudan There are more differences between the areas than those   South Sudan Concerning the demand for secularism   which alHilu s wing   adamant   the negotiations with the government Agar says   are not against the secularism   the state and I believe the overwhelming majority   the Sudanese support   But   the same time   say that secularism and the relationship between the state and religion are not issues that concern the areas only   warns   the danger   bilateral discussions about secularism and the relationship between the state and religion This     enormous burden and responsibility   I believe   should   left   all the Sudanese   decide   a subsequent constitutional conference that   held   the suitable time   enable everybody   make their opinions known   Agar believes that alHilu s demand for the existence   armies   Sudan his own army and the Sudanese army   not practical because this would need resources the territories   not possess unlike the situation   South Sudan which owns per cent   Sudan s petroleum resources and   thus able   finance its army But   our case     not have percent   the resources that would enable     finance a huge army   the territories while   the same time being able   finance development needs   adds: These are the issues   disagree about   has not compromised   them and   have not agreed with him   them During the mediation   Salva Kiir   unify the movements which still adhere   the slogans and programmes   the mother SPLM   South Sudan there were leaks about personal dimensions involved and that alHilu insists   excluding certain personalities   order   unify the movement But Agar I know nothing about this and you can refer back   the source that told you alHilu has reservations   the return   certain individuals   added: The problem   that alHilu   raising three issues   have not agreed about yet but     not have personal differences with him I have known him since before the creation   the SPLM and   were comrades   clandestine action before the SPLM was formed   worked together for more than years   the SPLM after   was formed and I   not think that there are issues   contention between     individuals These are organisational issues but the Sudanese like   personalise things although     not have any personal considerations Abdel Aziz   not   enemy   ours and     a longtime comrade   struggle     not among our enemies whether   agree with him   not and   fully respect him Agar regrets the split that has turned the SPLMN into delegations sitting separately   negotiate   the same issues   says the split was pointless   has weakened   politically and militarily and   had   need for     begin with     says the agreement with the Transitional Government   the delivery   humanitarian aid applies   the areas his movement controls There are other areas alHilu controls   which   have   presence   the agreement not apply   these areas   Civilian entities from central northern and eastern Sudan are participating   the Juba negotiations They are not armed movements and their introduction   the talks   considered   many   a distraction particularly since their demands can   solved from Khartoum But Agar believes their involvement contributes   solving Sudan s problem   a practical manner The presence   all the powers and all those that want   join   the negotiations would   important     want   solve the Sudanese problem and the various outstanding demands particularly those   the various regions   These are equally important   the issues pertaining   war and peace   should deal with them   that the signature   the protocols would mean that   have worked out a comprehensive agreement that addresses them A paradox   perhaps that most   the movements and groups negotiating   Juba came from Khartoum A superficial questir may ask Why are you negotiating   Juba   you came from Khartoum?
3,Agar answers: Yes all the movements were   Khartoum but did not conduct any negotiations there because the platform was set for Juba and the mediator   here   Juba The delegations were   Khartoum

fluidity   contested boundaries through diverse media such   drawing photography sculpture video and textbased installations Over   the artist: Questions with Reena Kallat Blind Spots highlights your geopolitical concerns again What draws you   the subject?
4,The line     integral part     artist s tool kit and yet when drawn across territory decides the fate   citizens   either side While borders are a political construct I   primarily been interested   the psychological social barriers between more than the physical borders themselves   father was born   Lahore and had moved   the Indian side   Punjab prePartition but his elder brother had   move during Partition Growing   I was fascinated   stories about the homes they lived   Every three years owing     grandfather being a sessions court judge they were posted   a new place Yet like with most families there was silence around Partition I began examining the impact   the legacy   Partition when   own experience   living   Mumbai changed with growing divisiveness between religious communities after the riots   and   the part work Leaking Lines besides the Radcliffe Line Durand   the McMahon Line I began looking   several others such   the MasonDixon line the Blue Line and the Green Line While   the hand     blurred these lines through trade technology and commerce there   a strong reemergence   national borders amidst   today I   worked with the electric wire     medium which   a transmitter   energy a communication cable that connects   and yet here   morphs into barbed wire and fences The scale and ambition   the works are institutional and expressed through various mediums   you     artist feel the medium takes away from the matter?
5,The relationship   the viewer   the work and scale plays   important role   how the work gets received I first began working with the Preamble   the Constitution   India     a time when there was resistance towards north Indian migrants within the city   Mumbai and I wanted   remind ourselves   the foundational values and principles embedded within this most inclusive document   the multichannelled video installation Blind Spots I m revisiting the promise   democracy   a time when most are under strain   reveals pairs   Snellen eye charts where alphabet   a time appears   a fragmented recital metaphorically indicative   our partial halftruths and fractured understanding   the whole These are the preambles   the constitutions   countries such   USCuba SudanSouth Sudan BangladeshIndia SerbiaCroatia North and South Korea besides IndiaPakistan   the founding promises within each pair   nationstates are revealed alphabet   a time the shared principles such   equality justice liberty common   both preambles morph into braillelike dots The work invites audiences   reflect   how   seem   have lost sight   these common values and aspirations that are universal which cut across the idea   sovereign nation states What inspired the title   the show?
6,Blind Spots   derived from the physiological blind spot   medical literature   the missing compnt   our vision   see exactly alike and the brain interpolates the blind spot based   other information   conceptually complete the gap and derive meaning I think   these polarised times where the gaps   our understanding   the truth   increasingly widening I hope through art   can still find a space   reflect upon our shortcomings our perceptual limitations   understanding other perspectives     tune into signals from the natural they would remind     our interconnectedness and interdependence   each other The sound sculptures   Blind Spots are modelled   preradar acoustic devices built during the wars   track sounds   enemy aircrafts but I have replaced them with birdsongs The idea     subvert notions   war   having national birds singing   each other across borders Blind Spots ends   Dec Attend   informal walkthrough and conversation with the artist       Chemould Prescott Road
