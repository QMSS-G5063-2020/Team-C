pullout boosts the impression that   s all impulse blithely operating out   his depth One thing I think I   correctly observed about the U S military   the   century   that its leaders tend     the   want       war and the   want   leave   Political figures operate under public pressures and shifting geopolitical needs and goals they   surrounded   who see the a certain way they get revved   and say   invade Top military staff have reservations They   studied the area know the realities the history they have doctorates     and don t want   get into anything America can t win cleanly decisively relatively quickly They   skeptics   the end the commander   chief makes the decision and they   their constitutional duty Troops are deployed and perform They dig   and fight they   professionals they commit The political figures then decide after a few years   decades that   s time   come home Military leaders are skeptical again They   been   this thing a while they   committed   the battle space they   lost men they know and care about their allies   the fight they have a sharp sense   the repercussions   withdrawal They want more time I suspect the current habit   skepticism springs   part from the military s generationslong reckoning with Vietnam You can see       Gen H R McMaster s influential book Dereliction   Duty The war   Vietnam was not lost   the field nor was   lost   the front pages   the New York Times Donald Trump s second national security adviser writes   was lost   Washington D C Responsibility for the failure rested not only with President Lyndon B Johnson and his civilian advisers but his military advisers particularly the Joint Chiefs   Staff Between the lines Gen McMaster was telling the current military: Don t claim   see lights   the ends   tunnels when you don t really see them play   straight   forthcoming with political leaders and the public about likely costs and consequences Anyway history   human Military leaders have their ways and biases But public military opposition   the president s withdrawal   U S forces from northern Syria after a Sunday telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seems

 a distraught U S Special Forces soldier   the ground alongside the Kurdish forces that were about     abandoned   was   the hardest phone calls I have ever taken she tweeted The soldier told her I   ashamed for the first time     career   There was   threat   the Turks none from this side   the border The Kurds who are guarding thousands   ISIS prisoners had just prevented a prison break and were pleading for U S support Without   the soldier those detainees would likely soon   free   the president:   doesn t understand the problem   doesn t understand the repercussions   this   s a shame   added The Kurds are standing       other partner I have ever dealt with would stand     I believe every word   this Why this decision?
8,Why now?
9,redeem a campaign pledge with another campaign looming?
10,impulse?
11,What was behind the impulse?
12,The president doesn t seem   know much about the Kurds that they   backed the U S since and fought ISIS since They have their reasons: They want their own state But they are a gallant brave and sympathetic   the West The president defending this decision asked what   owe them They didn t help     the Second War   Normandy for example Yes I forgot Reagan made that point   his Pointe   Hoc speech   Don t forget   stick     the Kurds for not showing     wait   didn t say that because   was quite the reader   history   Trump   defending his position says     against the endless wars that have marked the first decades   this century Fair and good the right approach   ran for president opposing them and Americans left and right agreed But there   too much craziness   the decision both its substance and how   was made The area has been functioning the number   U S troops small and limited Adm Stavridis called   a small investment with a big spring     The decision was done   the word     Erdogan a particular kind   player thuggish duplicitous   considers the Kurds   his border a security threat   threatens   send Syrian refugees   Europe   European countries call his incursion   occupation   they insult him like that   open the gates and send million refugees your way   Trump himself says   the ISIS terrorists the Kurds are holding   prison are freed   escape   worry They   going     escaping   Europe   They want     back   their homes That s a viciously careless way   treat your allies Who   the way were   Normandy Most unsettling was the president s mad tweet assuring critics that his decision was right:   Turkey does anything that I     great and unmatched wisdom consider     off limits I totally destroy and obliterate the Economy   Turkey I   done before!
13,This isn t funny   s selfinflated nut stuff The president   misreading his base which have qualms Their sons and daughters fought   the wars they know who the Kurds are Why would     such a dramatic piercing thing   what   for him a dramatic piercing moment with impeachment looming and support for   rising   the polls?
14,Why offend Republicans senators whom the president needs   survive impeachment?
15,Why give them   excuse   start peeling off?
16,Why give those   his supporters who are cablenews hacks   excuse   show some pride?
17,I m not a lackey this   about principle the president has made a misjudgment!
18,Watch   they could get   the habit   selfrespect The Syria decision contributes   the hardened impression that   foreign policy   s all impulse blithely operating out   his depth   adds   the hardening suspicion that   negotiations   s not actually tough     say yes   a lot   things and some very bad things   get the deal the photoop the triumphant handshake Foreignpolicy decisions   this administration look like the ball   a pinball machine   some garish arcade with flashing lights and some frantic guy pushing the levers ping ping ping and thinking   s winning Turkey Has Legitimate Grievances Against the U S President Trump s critics see his decision   withdraw U S forces from northern Syria   the product   a dangerous impulsiveness that ignores strategic realities They argue that   betrays the s Protection Units   YPG the Kurdish force that helped the U S defeat Islamic State while rewarding a dangerous autocrat Turkey s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan But       Trump s critics who disregard reality Most members   America s foreignpolicy establishment see Turkey     ungrateful ally perhaps even a Trojan horse inside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization s walls   Capitol Hill and   many Washington think tanks a call for concessions   Tehran get a more sympathetic hearing than a call   compromise with Ankara a treaty ally for years Turkey s determination   secure its southern border against the YPG   a wanton impulse   the prevailing view But the YPG has substantial ties   the Kurdistan Workers Party the PKK   thenDefense Secretary Ash Carter testified before Congress   April Classified   the State Department   a terrorist organization the PKK has been waging armed struggle against Turkey since   a cost   tens   thousands   lives according   the Uppsala Conflict Data Program a respected source   armed conflict Turkey s critics point   Ankara s recent purchase   the S airdefense missile system from Russia   confirm their belief that   Erdogan   rupturing the U S Turkey relationship But that s   oversimplification that rests   a lazy assumption that   Erdogan s personality   the root   the rancor   AmericanTurkish relations   invokes his authoritarianism Islamist worldview hostility   Israel sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood and opposition   Kurdish nationalists inside and outside Turkey s borders   argue that Turkey   unworthy   U S support Some articles   this indictment rest   a more solid evidentiary base than others But the causes   Ankara s recent willingness   defy Washington   beyond man s personality Polls reliably indicate that     Turks regard the U S   a hostile power While antiAmericanism     old story   Turkey   recent years   has a sharper edge Turks increasingly see America   a threat This   a remarkable development   a country that had been a stalwart U S ally and partner for decades The levels   hostility   America cannot   laid     Erdogan s doorstep for   commands the support   only around   Turks Dissatisfaction with the U S stretches far beyond the president s   Party Why   the U S losing Turkey?
19,Turks have their own list   grievances   which three stand out First America s diffident Syria policy Ankara followed Washington s lead   backing the Syrian s attempt   overthrow the dictator Bashar Assad But when Turkey shot down a Russian combat jet violating its airspace   President Obama treated the episode more   a bilateral spat between third parties than   a conflict between America s key regional ally and a more powerful adversary   U S interests Left   its own Ankara realized   had little choice but   accommodate Moscow Vladimir Putin s steadfastness trumped   Obama s aloofness Thus was born the relationship that begot the S deal Second   the curious sympathy that America extends   Fethullah Gulen a gurulike religious figure who has been residing   Pennsylvania since The Department   Homeland Security originally denied   Gulen s application for a residence permit under the Bush administration finding that   Gulen s claims regarding his educational abilities were exaggerated   Gulen s schools have been investigated for immigration fraud and mismanagement though   charges have emerged Figures close     Gulen have been accused   playing key roles   the July coup attempt that took the lives   Turks Though   Gulen condemned the coup and denied any involvement former followers   his say that his organization   tightly centralized U S experts   Turkey such   James Jeffrey a former ambassador   Ankara say that   Gulen s followers have pursued power   Turkey   infiltrating government bodies Many Turks doubt   Gulen s supporters could participate   a coup without his blessing Before taking   his current position   the State Department s point man   Syria   Jeffrey stated that     embarrassing that   Gulen   sitting here   the United States How many Turks ask can the U S harbor such a despicable figure?
20,The third misdeed   the most consequential: the Obama administration s decision     arm and train YPG members and directly embed American special forces with them Rather than work with Turkey the U S chose   support the Syrian wing   the PKK which the Turkish public holds responsible for decades   warfare and tens   thousands   deaths The PKK represents a grave threat   the Turkish Republic and Turks across the political spectrum loathe     dismiss Ankara s objections   America s arming   the YPG   mere antiKurdish bigotry   ignorant akin   labeling the fight against   Qaeda   Islamophobia The purchase   the S s and the pressure   Erdogan   placing   U S forces   northern Syria provide a way   demonstrate   the broader Turkish public his willingness   defy Washington for its shabby treatment   Turkey and   restore the balance   power between Turkey and the PKK which American policy inadvertently overturned For the U S   retaliate against Turkey and alienate   permanently would   folly       now when   Erdogan s support   waning and democracy   Turkey   showing its vibrant face would hand   Putin a gift   couldn t have dreamed   Trump s Jacksonian Syria Withdrawal Under investigation for impeachment   may   but President Trump can still shake the with his tweets Explaining his decision   pull U S troops away from the TurkishSyrian border   the cost   the Kurdishled Syrian Democratic Forces and open the way for Turkish forces   create what Ankara calls a safety zone President Trump tweeted early Monday that     time for     get out   these ridiculous Endless Wars many   them tribal and bring our soldiers home Hitting the capslock button   Trump went     restate   his bedrock beliefs and a cornerstone   Jacksonian foreignpolicy thinking:   ONLY FIGHT WHERE       OUR BENEFIT AND ONLY FIGHT   WIN   for concerns that a U S withdrawal would allow Islamic State   reform   Trump was dismissive   are miles away and crush ISIS again   they come anywhere near  !
21,Criticism     Trump s withdrawal decision has been intense with prominent supporters like Sen Lindsey Graham and former officials like Nikki Haley joining longtime opponents   the White House Much   that criticism   justified and the erratic nature   Trumpera policy making   well   the oftenunpredictable policy mix that results are undercutting American prestige and influence   much   the world But not all   the problems dogging the Trump administration Middle East policy are caused     Trump s sometimes idiosyncratic views   policymaking style   other news stories from the Middle East week make clear the American position   the region     odd mix   dominance and impotence that makes good policy making hard and that makes the task   building domestic support for smart policy even harder The first development   a success story that underlines how dominant the U S has become: Fearing U S sanctions China National Petroleum Corp has abandoned plans for a multibilliondollar investment   Iran s South Pars gas field This   part   a broader Chinese retreat from Iran   the face   American pressure the Middle Kingdom isn t yet ready   challenge the U S   the Middle East The second development the violent protests shaking Iraq tells   something equally important The U S may   the paramount power   the region but nobody has a solution   the developmental and political crisis that continues   destabilize too many countries across the Middle East   Iraq there     political party   social movement with the vision discipline and competence   create the kind   country the protesters say they want Iraq s politicians can t deliver the goods Nor can its civil society military   religious leadership More the U S the European Union and the international financial institutions engaged   Iraq don t know how   bridge the gap between the aspirations   the Iraqi and the shambles   the nation s political life The reforms a desperate Iraqi government   proposing   hope   quieting the unrest mostly make things worse Parliament Speaker Mohammed alHalbousi has promised for example   place every Iraqi with a master s degree   above   the Education Ministry s payroll Such measures would degrade the country s finances tighten the grip   power   corrupt political parties and block the kinds   change that might someday put Iraq   the road   success Iraq isn t the only country   the region that   trapped   a cycle   dysfunctional governance and blocked development The forces that produced the Arab Spring and those that frustrated   remain   work   the region Until and unless a path opens for serious economic development the Middle East continue   produce despotism revolution large streams   migrants and fanatical religious armies and cults   Trump isn t the first U S president   try   hold America back from a Middle East conflict President Obama made a similar and similarly hasty decision   when   chose not   respond   Syria s violation   his chemical weapons red line with a military strike Many   the same criticizing   Trump today criticized   Obama then and the subsequent course   the Syrian war underlined both the humanitarian and the strategic case against   Obama s decision   Trump s Syria decision may prove     a mistake but   should give the establishment pause that presidents   different   Messrs Obama and Trump reached similar conclusions about the political risks   the Middle East The U S may   the most powerful actor   the region but   can t resolve the economic and social conflicts that destabilize the Middle East   long   this   the case those who want presidents   commit   longterm military engagements however limited and however advantageous must expect a skeptical hearing   the Oval Office With Friends Like the U S The Kurds helped   defeat ISIS Trump leaves them   Erdogan President Trump s defeat   Islamic State   a territorial power was a major foreignpolicy success yet   may now undo   with a retreat from Syria that signal   U S allies that the White House can t   trusted That s the risk     Trump s abrupt decision late Sunday   abandon northern Syria   Turkey Washington and Ankara had been negotiating   create a buffer zone   avoid a conflict there but   Sunday the White House announced that American forces cede the area   Turkish troops Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan   now free   wage war   Syria s Kurds who were America s most important allies against ISIS   Erdogan says the U S armed Kurdish fighters   Syria known   the YPG have ties   the Kurdistan Workers Party a domestic Kurdish insurgency within Turkey   that exaggerated claim   justifies   exercise that could amount   ethnic cleansing   Erdogan month proposed a safe zone extending some miles into Syria from the Turkish border where   would resettle millions   Syrian refugees This could require the forcible resettlement   worse   Kurds already living   the area   Erdogan seems   have believed that the U S would help   this exercise But after a phone call with the Turkish strongman   Trump made clear that Turkey     its own That means   are the Kurds and the U S withdrew its troops from border posts A Kurdish spokesman tweeted   are not expecting the     protect   Syria But here are owed   explanation This looks like a betrayal   the YPG which lost soldiers fighting against ISIS America armed the Kurds   that fight and they trusted the U S when they were asked   dismantle defensive positions near the Turkish border   part   the bufferzone negotiations with Ankara The Kurds are less likely   aid   insurgency   Turkey   they   allowed   govern themselves   a safe area   Syria policed   the U S and Turkey   Trump compounded the injury with insult when   tweeted Monday morning that the Kurds fought with   but were paid massive amounts   money and equipment       For   Trump foreign policy   always a transaction never a matter   principle The Kurds have taken   the role   jailer   resort for the thousands   captured ISIS fighters   else wants   house   s not clear who   anyone assume that responsibility now that the U S   withdrawing The White House says   Erdogan   now responsible for all ISIS fighters   the region but   can t   trusted given his record   using refugees   bargaining chips with Western Europe Released European ISIS recruits could disperse   form cells   the region   find their way back   Europe There s the practical question   how   transfer control   prison camps from the Kurds   Turkish troops waging war against them Under heavy criticism from even friends   Congress   Trump tweeted later   Monday that   d totally destroy and obliterate the Economy   Turkey     Erdogan does anything off limits Administration sources say this   a warning     Erdogan not   massacre the Kurds   free ISIS prisoners   the risk   U S economic sanctions But   Erdogan knows   Trump badly wants out   the Middle East and might call the American s bluff     time for     get out   these ridiculous Endless Wars   Trump tweeted Monday   Erdogan could choose   slowly strangle the Kurds figuring that won t   enough   trigger   Trump s sanctions   a NATO ally Washington can   least deny Turkish jet fighters airspace over Kurdish areas which would raise the costs for   Erdogan   a fullscale invasion Like Barack Obama   Trump thinks   can wash his hands   Syria   little cost But the resulting vacuum allowed ISIS   grow Russia   intervene and now Iran   establish its proxies   Israel s border Within three years U S troops were back   the ground   Obama left   Trump with a bad Syria hand but the President risks making the same mistake Economic sanctions won t deflect White House blame for a Kurdish bloodbath And   ISIS revives the U S have     back   this time without Kurdish allies   the ground   Trump may want   leave the Middle East but chaos there follow him home Trump and the Globalists President Trump   the United Nations this week elaborated   his longrunning antagonism toward globalism The future does not belong   globalists   Trump The future belongs   patriots The future belongs   sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique There   merit   these concerns but I think the critics   globalism including most prominently   Trump underestimate the nearterm danger   the serious difficulties appearing today   national democratic governance Democracies maintain their legitimacy   the public s eye only   they demonstrate a reasonable capacity   address society s inevitably complex challenges Especially now with   Jinping   China and Vladimir Putin   Russia and even Iran s Hassan Rouhani actively offering     alternative model the administrative state   authoritarian steroids Democracies always struggle   perform but   s clear that many   the   century s independent nations are having a remarkably difficult time executing their sovereign responsibilities Starting here Congress the more than yearold legislative branch   the U S government   deadlocked with even the passage   a national budget becoming impossible Defuse the U S entitlement bombs?
