Even   the ingredients were available hyperinflation would make them much too expensive for ordinary citizens   Simonovis s story     many respects the story   Venezuela under the Bolivarian socialist regime that has ravaged the country since Hugo Chavez came   power   The deprivation   freedom has accompanied the destruction   the economy and the arrest and imprisonment     Simonovis initially

officers intervened   halt the mayhem and that mostly involved protecting the unarmed marchers from proChavez gunfire Inevitably the regime accused   Simonovis   siding with the opposition That s when the accusations started that I was CIA   says They wanted a scapegoat for Llaguno months later   Simonovis resigned fed   with the regime s hostility   started a security consultancy with clients

nurse would come down   see   and the other political prisoners some bankers and others from time   time His verdict always was that I was a healthy adult His wife visited him when the authorities permitted sometimes with the children Then she spoke   the press indignantly describing his treatment Whenever she did that   says they punished   They would curtail her visits Sometimes they would

future seemed   bleak   says   the verdict was absurd Chavez had consolidated his suffocating control   the tiniest concession   Simonovis was permitted     into the sun for minutes each morning Sometimes   was just five minutes The men guarding   were occasionally men I knew   was awkward Mostly they were young recruits who didn t know how   deal with a man     rank His condition eased     was shifted   a military prison   Ramo Verde miles southwest   Caracas There his cell had some natural light and air and   had occasional visits   a doctor They treated   with more dignity here   says
