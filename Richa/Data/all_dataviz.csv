leader interviewed   peace talks Malik Agar     the northerners who sided with South Sudan during the civil war   joined the late John Garang s Sudan s Liberation Movement SPLM After South Sudan s separation   led the movement s northern branch which became known   the Sudan s Liberation Movement North SPLMN That northern offshoot subsequently split into wings each with the same name The larger

delivery   humanitarian assistance   the areas under his movement s control   the southern Blue Nile   considered this a step toward bolstering trust paving the way for peace and inspiring hope that peace   coming   started with humanitarian issues because they are related   the suffering   the citizens     want a peace that the citizens the displaced and the refugees can feel     manage   deliver food and medicine   them   would have paved the way for peace and trustbuilding and created hope for   eventual settlement According   Malik the protocol signed with the Transitional Government covers other issues   addition   the delivery   humanitarian assistance These include a cessation   hostilities and formation   committees   monitor implementation Humanitarian assistance flow   from inside and outside Sudan from organisations inside and outside the country     June the Nuba Mountains Liberation Council decided   appoint Abdel Aziz alHilu   SPLMN leader and remove Agar and secretarygeneral Yasir Arman   decided   ban the men from entering the liberated areas   the southern Blue Nile and South Kordofan The ban was justified   the grounds that Agar and Arman refuse   include selfdetermination rights   the negotiations with the government even though     what the Nuba Mountains want This sparked violent clashes   which dozens were killed because   ethnic mobilisation Since that time the SPLMN split into movements   exerted enormous efforts for a long time   avoid this before the split and when   started Agar   this connection   offered six initiatives   prevent the split   addition   the initiatives proposed   South Sudan s President Salva Kiir Mayardit who mediated three meetings with alHilu   addition   the initiatives made   friendly heads   state But all failed and   were unable   agree   a least common denominator Brother Abdel Aziz   intransigent   his position which   not acceptable     because   believe the demands     insisting upon cannot   accomplished   reached Agar points out   this connection that the separation   South Sudan from Sudan did not solve the problem but   the contrary worsened     the separation did not solve the problems   South Sudan but made them more intractable how then can   consider selfdetermination   a mechanism for a solution?
13,asks AlHilu   demanding selfdetermination for the Blue Nile and South Kordofan through a referendum   independence and the establishment   a secular state But Agar says   believe that granting selfdetermination   the areas   the pattern   the South Sudan experiment would   futile and would prolong the war instead   bringing peace closer There are objective reasons for this belief including the fact that there     geographical contiguity between the areas and because there are Arab tribes there unlike the situation   South Sudan There are more differences between the areas than those   South Sudan Concerning the demand for secularism   which alHilu s wing   adamant   the negotiations with the government Agar says   are not against the secularism   the state and I believe the overwhelming majority   the Sudanese support   But   the same time   say that secularism and the relationship between the state and religion are not issues that concern the areas only   warns   the danger   bilateral discussions about secularism and the relationship between the state and religion This     enormous burden and responsibility   I believe   should   left   all the Sudanese   decide   a subsequent constitutional conference that   held   the suitable time   enable everybody   make their opinions known   Agar believes that alHilu s demand for the existence   armies   Sudan his own army and the Sudanese army   not practical because this would need resources the territories   not possess unlike the situation   South Sudan which owns per cent   Sudan s petroleum resources and   thus able   finance its army But   our case     not have percent   the resources that would enable     finance a huge army   the territories while   the same time being able   finance development needs   adds: These are the issues   disagree about   has not compromised   them and   have not agreed with him   them During the mediation   Salva Kiir   unify the movements which still adhere   the slogans and programmes   the mother SPLM   South Sudan there were leaks about personal dimensions involved and that alHilu insists   excluding certain personalities   order   unify the movement But Agar I know nothing about this and you can refer back   the source that told you alHilu has reservations   the return   certain individuals   added: The problem   that alHilu   raising three issues   have not agreed about yet but     not have personal differences with him I have known him since before the creation   the SPLM and   were comrades   clandestine action before the SPLM was formed   worked together for more than years   the SPLM after   was formed and I   not think that there are issues   contention between     individuals These are organisational issues but the Sudanese like   personalise things although     not have any personal considerations Abdel Aziz   not   enemy   ours and     a longtime comrade   struggle     not among our enemies whether   agree with him   not and   fully respect him Agar regrets the split that has turned the SPLMN into delegations sitting separately   negotiate   the same issues   says the split was pointless   has weakened   politically and militarily and   had   need for     begin with     says the agreement with the Transitional Government   the delivery   humanitarian aid applies   the areas his movement controls There are other areas alHilu controls   which   have   presence   the agreement not apply   these areas   Civilian entities from central northern and eastern Sudan are participating   the Juba negotiations They are not armed movements and their introduction   the talks   considered   many   a distraction particularly since their demands can   solved from Khartoum But Agar believes their involvement contributes   solving Sudan s problem   a practical manner The presence   all the powers and all those that want   join   the negotiations would   important     want   solve the Sudanese problem and the various outstanding demands particularly those   the various regions   These are equally important   the issues pertaining   war and peace   should deal with them   that the signature   the protocols would mean that   have worked out a comprehensive agreement that addresses them A paradox   perhaps that most   the movements and groups negotiating   Juba came from Khartoum A superficial questir may ask Why are you negotiating   Juba   you came from Khartoum?
14,Agar answers: Yes all the movements were   Khartoum but did not conduct any negotiations there because the platform was set for Juba and the mediator   here   Juba The delegations were   Khartoum   clear the atmosphere and build trust not   negotiate Agar expressed optimism about reaching a peace agreement   bases himself   the experience   negotiating with the regime   the deposed Omar alBashir

15,The line     integral part     artist s tool kit and yet when drawn across territory decides the fate   citizens   either side While borders are a political construct I   primarily been interested   the psychological social barriers between more than the physical borders themselves   father was born   Lahore and had moved   the Indian side   Punjab prePartition but his elder brother had   move during Partition Growing   I was fascinated   stories about the homes they lived   Every three years owing     grandfather being a sessions court judge they were posted   a new place Yet like with most families there was silence around Partition I began examining the impact   the legacy   Partition when   own experience   living   Mumbai changed with growing divisiveness between religious communities after the riots   and   the part work Leaking Lines besides the Radcliffe Line Durand   the McMahon Line I began looking   several others such   the MasonDixon line the Blue Line and the Green Line While   the hand     blurred these lines through trade technology and commerce there   a strong reemergence   national borders amidst   today I   worked with the electric wire     medium which   a transmitter   energy a communication cable that connects   and yet here   morphs into barbed wire and fences The scale and ambition   the works are institutional and expressed through various mediums   you     artist feel the medium takes away from the matter?
16,The relationship   the viewer   the work and scale plays   important role   how the work gets received I first began working with the Preamble   the Constitution   India     a time when there was resistance towards north Indian migrants within the city   Mumbai and I wanted   remind ourselves   the foundational values and principles embedded within this most inclusive document   the multichannelled video installation Blind Spots I m revisiting the promise   democracy   a time when most are under strain   reveals pairs   Snellen eye charts where alphabet   a time appears   a fragmented recital metaphorically indicative   our partial halftruths and fractured understanding   the whole These are the preambles   the constitutions   countries such   USCuba SudanSouth Sudan BangladeshIndia SerbiaCroatia North and South Korea besides IndiaPakistan   the founding promises within each pair   nationstates are revealed alphabet   a time the shared principles such   equality justice liberty common   both preambles morph into braillelike dots The work invites audiences   reflect   how   seem   have lost sight   these common values and aspirations that are universal which cut across the idea   sovereign nation states What inspired the title   the show?
17,Blind Spots   derived from the physiological blind spot   medical literature   the missing compnt   our vision   see exactly alike and the brain interpolates the blind spot based   other

impulse blithely operating out   his depth thing I think I   correctly observed about the U S military   the   century   that its leaders tend     the   want       war and the   want   leave   Political figures operate under public pressures and shifting geopolitical needs and goals they   surrounded   who see the a certain way they get revved   and say   invade Top military staff have reservations They   studied the area know the realities the history they have doctorates     and don t want   get into anything America can t win cleanly decisively relatively quickly They   skeptics   the end the commander   chief makes the decision and they   their constitutional duty Troops are deployed and perform They dig   and fight they   professionals they commit The political figures then decide after a few years   decades that   s time   come home Military leaders are skeptical again They   been   this thing a while they   committed   the battle space they   lost men they know and care about their allies   the fight they have a sharp sense   the repercussions   withdrawal They want more time I suspect the current habit   skepticism springs   part from the military s generationslong reckoning with Vietnam You can see       Gen H R McMaster s influential book Dereliction   Duty The war   Vietnam was not lost   the field nor was   lost   the front pages   the New York Times Donald Trump s second national security adviser writes   was lost   Washington D C Responsibility for the failure rested not only with President Lyndon B Johnson and his civilian advisers but his military advisers particularly the Joint Chiefs   Staff Between the lines Gen McMaster was telling the current military: Don t claim   see lights   the ends   tunnels when you don t really see them play   straight   forthcoming with political leaders and the public about likely costs and consequences Anyway history   human Military leaders have their ways and biases But public military opposition   the president s withdrawal   U S forces from northern Syria after a Sunday teleph call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seems     completely correct Gen John Allen a retired

Graham and Bernie Sanders More compelling   what Jennifer Griffin the respected nationalsecurity correspondent for Fox News reported Wednesday night She spoke   a distraught U S Special Forces soldier   the ground alongside the Kurdish forces that were about     abandd   was   the hardest   calls I have ever taken she tweeted The soldier told her I   ashamed for the first time     career   There was   threat   the Turks n from this side   the border The Kurds who are guarding thousands   ISIS prisrs had just prevented a prison break and were pleading for U S support Without   the soldier those detainees would likely soon   free   the president:   doesn t understand the problem   doesn t understand the repercussions   this   s a shame   added The Kurds are standing       other partner I have ever dealt with would stand     I believe every word   this Why this decision?
31,Why now?
32,redeem a campaign pledge with another campaign looming?
33,impulse?
34,What was behind the impulse?
35,The president doesn t seem   know much about the Kurds that they   backed the U S since and fought ISIS since They have their reasons: They want their own state But they are a gallant brave and sympathetic   the West The president defending this decision asked what   owe them They didn t help     the Second War   Normandy for example Yes I forgot Reagan made that point   his Pointe   Hoc speech   Don t forget   stick     the Kurds for not showing     wait   didn t say that because   was quite the reader   history   Trump   defending his position says     against the endless wars that have marked the first decades   this century Fair and good the right approach   ran for president opposing them and Americans left and right agreed But there   too much craziness   the decision both its substance and how   was made The area has been functioning the number   U S troops small and limited Adm Stavridis called   a small investment with a big spring     The decision was d   the word     Erdogan a particular kind   player thuggish duplicitous   considers the Kurds   his border a security threat   threatens   send Syrian refugees   Europe   European countries call his incursion   occupation   they insult him like that   open the gates and send million refugees your way   Trump himself says   the ISIS terrorists the Kurds are holding   prison are freed   escape   worry They   going     escaping   Europe   They want     back   their homes That s a viciously careless way   treat your allies Who   the way were   Normandy Most unsettling was the president s mad tweet assuring critics that his decision was right:   Turkey does anything that I     great and unmatched wisdom consider     off limits I totally destroy and obliterate the Economy   Turkey I   d before!
36,This isn t funny   s selfinflated nut stuff The president   misreading his base which have qualms Their sons and daughters fought   the wars they know who the Kurds are Why would     such a dramatic piercing thing   what   for him a dramatic piercing moment with impeachment looming and support for   rising   the polls?
37,Why offend Republicans senators whom the president needs   survive impeachment?
38,Why give them   excuse   start peeling off?
39,Why give those   his supporters who are cablenews hacks   excuse   show some pride?
40,I m not a lackey this   about principle the president has made a misjudgment!
41,Watch   they could get   the habit   selfrespect The Syria decision contributes   the hardened impression that   foreign policy   s all impulse blithely operating out   his depth   adds   the hardening suspicion that   negotiations   s not actually tough     say yes   a lot   things and some very bad things   get the deal the photoop the triumphant handshake Foreignpolicy decisions   this administration look like the ball   a pinball machine   some garish arcade with flashing lights and some frantic guy pushing the levers ping ping ping and thinking   s winning Turkey Has Legitimate Grievances Against the U S President Trump s critics see his decision   withdraw U S forces from northern Syria   the product   a dangerous impulsiveness that ignores strategic realities They argue that   betrays the s Protection Units   YPG the Kurdish force that helped the U S defeat Islamic State while rewarding a dangerous autocrat Turkey s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan But       Trump s critics who disregard reality Most members   America s foreignpolicy establishment see Turkey     ungrateful ally perhaps even a Trojan horse inside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization s walls   Capitol Hill and   many Washington think tanks a call for concessions   Tehran get a more sympathetic hearing than a call   compromise with Ankara a treaty ally for years Turkey s determination   secure its southern border against the YPG   a wanton impulse   the prevailing view But the YPG has substantial ties   the Kurdistan Workers Party the PKK   thenDefense Secretary Ash Carter testified before Congress   April Classified   the State Department   a terrorist organization the PKK has been waging armed struggle against Turkey since   a cost   tens   thousands   lives according   the Uppsala Conflict Data Program a respected source   armed conflict Turkey s critics point   Ankara s recent purchase   the S airdefense missile system from Russia   confirm their belief that   Erdogan   rupturing the U S Turkey relationship But that s   oversimplification that rests   a lazy assumption that   Erdogan s personality   the root   the rancor   AmericanTurkish relations   invokes his authoritarianism Islamist view hostility   Israel sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood and opposition   Kurdish nationalists inside and outside Turkey s borders   argue that Turkey   unworthy   U S support Some articles   this indictment rest   a more solid evidentiary base than others But the causes   Ankara s recent ingness   defy Washington   beyond man s personality Polls reliably indicate that     Turks regard the U S   a hostile power While antiAmericanism     old story   Turkey   recent years   has a sharper edge Turks increasingly see America   a threat This   a remarkable development   a country that had been a stalwart U S ally and partner for decades The levels   hostility   America cannot   laid     Erdogan s doorstep for   commands the support   only around   Turks Dissatisfaction with the U S stretches far beyond the president s   Party Why   the U S losing Turkey?
42,Turks have their own list   grievances   which three stand out First America s diffident Syria policy Ankara followed Washington s lead   backing the Syrian s attempt   overthrow the dictator Bashar Assad But when Turkey shot down a Russian combat jet violating its airspace   President Obama treated the episode more   a bilateral spat between third parties than   a conflict between America s key regional ally and a more powerful adversary   U S interests Left   its own Ankara realized   had little choice but   accommodate Moscow Vladimir Putin s steadfastness trumped   Obama s aloofness Thus was born the relationship that begot the S deal Second   the curious sympathy that America extends   Fethullah Gulen a gurulike religious figure who has been residing   Pennsylvania since The Department   Homeland Security originally denied   Gulen s application for a residence permit under the Bush administration finding that   Gulen s claims regarding his educational abilities were exaggerated   Gulen s schools have been investigated for immigration fraud and mismanagement though   charges have emerged Figures close     Gulen have been accused   playing key roles   the July coup attempt that took the lives   Turks Though   Gulen condemned the coup and denied any involvement former followers   his say that his organization   tightly centralized U S experts   Turkey such   James Jeffrey a former ambassador   Ankara say that   Gulen s followers have pursued power   Turkey   infiltrating government bodies Many Turks doubt   Gulen s supporters could participate   a coup without his blessing Before taking   his current position   the State Department s point man   Syria   Jeffrey stated that     embarrassing that   Gulen   sitting here   the United States How many Turks ask can the U S harbor such a despicable figure?
43,The third misdeed   the most consequential: the Obama administration s decision     arm and train YPG members and directly embed American special forces with them Rather than work with Turkey the U S chose   support the Syrian wing   the PKK which the Turkish public holds responsible for decades   warfare and tens   thousands   deaths The PKK represents a grave threat   the Turkish Republic and Turks across the political spectrum loathe     dismiss Ankara s objections   America s arming   the YPG   mere antiKurdish bigotry   ignorant akin   labeling the fight against   Qaeda   Islamophobia The purchase   the S s and the pressure   Erdogan   placing   U S forces   northern Syria provide a way   demonstrate   the broader Turkish public his ingness   defy Washington for its shabby treatment   Turkey and   restore the balance   power between Turkey and the PKK which American policy inadvertently overturned For the U S   retaliate against Turkey and alienate   permanently would   folly       now when   Erdogan s support   waning and democracy   Turkey   showing its vibrant face would hand   Putin a gift   couldn t have dreamed   Trump s Jacksonian Syria Withdrawal Under investigation for impeachment   may   but President Trump can still shake the with his tweets Explaining his decision   pull U S troops away from the TurkishSyrian border   the cost   the Kurdishled Syrian Democratic Forces and open the way for Turkish forces   create what Ankara calls a safety z President Trump tweeted early Monday that     time for     get out   these ridiculous Endless Wars many   them tribal and bring our soldiers home Hitting the capslock button   Trump went     restate   his bedrock beliefs and a cornerst   Jacksonian foreignpolicy thinking:   ONLY FIGHT WHERE       OUR BENEFIT AND ONLY FIGHT   WIN   for concerns that a U S withdrawal would allow Islamic State   reform   Trump was dismissive   are miles away and crush ISIS again   they come anywhere near  !
44,Criticism     Trump s withdrawal decision has been intense with prominent supporters like Sen Lindsey Graham and former officials like Nikki Haley joining longtime oppnts   the White House Much   that criticism   justified and the erratic nature   Trumpera policy making   well   the oftenunpredictable policy mix that results are undercutting American prestige and influence   much   the But not all   the problems dogging the Trump administration Middle East policy are caused     Trump s sometimes idiosyncratic views   policymaking style   other news stories from the Middle East week make clear the American position   the region     odd mix   dominance and impotence that makes good policy making hard and that makes the task   building domestic support for smart policy even harder The first development   a success story that underlines how dominant the U S has become: Fearing U S sanctions China National Petroleum Corp has abandd plans for a multibilliondollar investment   Iran s South Pars gas field This   part   a broader Chinese retreat from Iran   the face   American pressure the Middle Kingdom isn t yet ready   challenge the U S   the Middle East The second development the violent protests shaking Iraq tells   something equally important The U S may   the paramount power   the region but nobody has a solution   the developmental and political crisis that continues   destabilize too many countries across the Middle East   Iraq there     political party   social movement with the vision discipline and competence   create the kind   country the protesters say they want Iraq s politicians can t deliver the goods Nor can its civil society military   religious leadership More the U S the European Union and the international financial institutions engaged   Iraq don t know how   bridge the gap between the aspirations   the Iraqi and the shambles   the nation s political life The reforms a desperate Iraqi government   proposing   hope   quieting the unrest mostly make things worse Parliament Speaker Mohammed alHalbousi has promised for example   place every Iraqi with a master s degree   above   the Education Ministry s payroll Such measures would degrade the country s finances tighten the grip   power   corrupt political parties and block the kinds   change that might someday put Iraq   the road   success Iraq isn t the only country   the region that   trapped   a cycle   dysfunctional governance and blocked development The forces that produced the Arab Spring and those that frustrated   remain   work   the region Until and unless a path opens for serious economic development the Middle East continue   produce despotism revolution large streams   migrants and fanatical religious armies and cults   Trump isn t the first U S president   try   hold America back from a Middle East conflict President Obama made a similar and similarly hasty decision   when   chose not   respond   Syria s violation   his chemical weapons red line with a military strike Many   the same criticizing   Trump today criticized   Obama then and the subsequent course   the Syrian war underlined both the humanitarian and the strategic case against   Obama s decision   Trump s Syria decision may prove     a mistake but   should give the establishment pause that presidents   different   Messrs Obama and Trump reached similar conclusions about the political risks   the Middle East The U S may   the most powerful actor   the region but   can t resolve the economic and social conflicts that destabilize the Middle East   long   this   the case those who want presidents   commit   longterm military engagements however limited and however advantageous must expect a skeptical hearing   the Oval Office With Friends Like the U S The Kurds helped   defeat ISIS Trump leaves them   Erdogan President Trump s defeat   Islamic State   a territorial power was a major foreignpolicy success yet   may now undo   with a retreat from Syria that signal   U S allies that the White House can t   trusted That s the risk     Trump s abrupt decision late Sunday   abandon northern Syria   Turkey Washington and Ankara had been negotiating   create a buffer z   avoid a conflict there but   Sunday the White House announced that American forces cede the area   Turkish troops Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan   now free   wage war   Syria s Kurds who were America s most important allies against ISIS   Erdogan says the U S armed Kurdish fighters   Syria known   the YPG have ties   the Kurdistan Workers Party a domestic Kurdish insurgency within Turkey   that exaggerated claim   justifies   exercise that could amount   ethnic cleansing   Erdogan month proposed a safe z extending some miles into Syria from the Turkish border where   would resettle millions   Syrian refugees This could require the forcible resettlement   worse   Kurds already living   the area   Erdogan seems   have believed that the U S would help   this exercise But after a   call with the Turkish strongman   Trump made clear that Turkey     its own That means   are the Kurds and the U S withdrew its troops from border posts A Kurdish spokesman tweeted   are not expecting the     protect   Syria But here are owed   explanation This looks like a betrayal   the YPG which lost soldiers fighting against ISIS America armed the Kurds   that fight and they trusted the U S when they were asked   dismantle defensive positions near the Turkish border   part   the bufferz negotiations with Ankara The Kurds are less likely   aid   insurgency   Turkey   they   allowed   govern themselves   a safe area   Syria policed   the U S and Turkey   Trump compounded the injury with insult when   tweeted Monday morning that the Kurds fought with   but were paid massive amounts     and equipment       For   Trump foreign policy   always a transaction never a matter   principle The Kurds have taken   the role   jailer   resort for the thousands   captured ISIS fighters   else wants   house   s not clear who   any assume that responsibility now that the U S   withdrawing The White House says   Erdogan   now responsible for all ISIS fighters   the region but   can t   trusted given his record   using refugees   bargaining chips with Western Europe Released European ISIS recruits could disperse   form cells   the region   find their way back   Europe There s the practical question   how   transfer control   prison camps from the Kurds   Turkish troops waging war against them Under heavy criticism from even friends   Congress   Trump tweeted later   Monday that   d totally destroy and obliterate the Economy   Turkey     Erdogan does anything off limits Administration sources say this   a warning     Erdogan not   massacre the Kurds   free ISIS prisrs   the risk   U S economic sanctions But   Erdogan knows   Trump badly wants out   the Middle East and might call the American s bluff     time for     get out   these ridiculous Endless Wars   Trump tweeted Monday   Erdogan could choose   slowly strangle the Kurds figuring that won t   enough   trigger   Trump s sanctions   a NATO ally Washington can   least deny Turkish jet fighters airspace over Kurdish areas which would raise the costs for   Erdogan   a fullscale invasion Like Barack Obama   Trump thinks   can wash his hands   Syria   little cost But the resulting vacuum allowed ISIS   grow Russia   intervene and now Iran   establish its proxies   Israel s border Within three years U S troops were back   the ground   Obama left   Trump with a bad Syria hand but the
